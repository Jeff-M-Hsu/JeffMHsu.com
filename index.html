      <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
      <p>
        My name is Jeffrey Hsu. I am a 23 year old full stack developer who graduated from the University of Western Ontario
	    in 2018 with a Bachelor of Science: <i>Specialization in Computer Science</i>. I originally chose to enter this field
	    because my favorite thing to do was play video games. The difficulty, the mental interactivity, and feeling of 
	    accomplishment when overcoming adversity made me realize that the two weren't so far apart and that becoming a developer could 
	    be just what I need to progress in life. As someone whose life has been largely influenced by the choices of those around me, this 
	    is one of the first that I have made by myself. I am still at the beginning of my career but I know that this is the right 
	    path for me!
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Aside from programming, my previous years have led me to take on a few hobbies that I didn't expect to enjoy as much as I do.
	    The first is cooking. I grew up watching cooking shows instead of cartoons. Every morning before elementary school was Michael Smith's 
	    Chef at Home instead of Spongebob Squarepants, and as I grew older it transitioned into Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations and 
	    Mind of a Chef instead of The Simpsons and Family Guy. Speaking of choices, my eldest brother chose to become a chef; brothers being 
	    brothers, I was essentially forced to watch cooking shows instead of cartoons. This however led me to become interested in what things tasted like 
	    and it taught me how to cook. All the techniques and knowledge of flavor profiles I picked up along the way has turned me into one of the best cooks 
	    I know, even my brother has acknowledged my particular ability to cook all sorts of meats to perfection and he works as the "big man on the grill" at 
	    a steakhouse. 
	  </p>

	    Another hobby I didn't know I would become obssessed with is lifting weights. In high school I weighed close to 130 pounds at a height of 6'1", yet 
	    still managed to have a gut because all I did was play video games from 4pm to midnight. I was tired all the time, and could barely participate in P.E. classes. 
	    Embarrassingly, I couldn't even do a single sit up or push up even if I had assistance! The last straw was in senior year of high school when we were just about to graduate; 
	    a lot of the other guys were quite fit and always talking about muscles and lifting big numbers while I still considered an 8 pound dumbbell to be heavy. On the final week 
	    before graduation, I set my mind on going from a gut to having a six pack before the end of summer. Amazingly, I managed to pull it off! Going into first year of university 
	    I started to slack again from being out on my own for the first time, but I got myself together by the second year and I'm now at the point where I don't feel right if I miss 
	    a day at the gym. Now I weigh 175 pounds with a lower body fat percentage than I did at 130 pounds, and can bench 180, squat 235, deadlift 330, and press 120, which is a far 
	    cry from where I started.

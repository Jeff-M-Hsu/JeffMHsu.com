		A gaming community named HoneyComb commissioned me to build a website for them to 
		recruit new members with. It was designed in collaboration with the community leader and 
		has a responsive layout that tranforms to support mobile and desktop resolutions. 
		</p>
		<p>
		They also requested the ability to display bee jokes and facts on the website through an interactive medium. 
		I fulfilled this request by creating a database of bee related information and an API that links to it. 
		My choice to use react as the front end of the site was to give this feature the requested interactivity, although 
		Angular would have been a great alternative.
		</p>
		<p>
		A few weeks after the initial launch of the site, the client came back and asked me to extend the site 
		by adding an infographic and a handful of memes. One issue I encountered is that React is typically used to 
		make single page applications and adding the extra features would make the page too long and unorganized. 
		While it is possible to have multi-paged applications through the use of react-router, there was no need 
		to do so since the extra features were just static content. I solved this issue by using CSS to make false pages, 
		categorizing content to only be visible when the user clicks on a 'page' tab. With this method, it fulfills the 
		client's request while being quick to implement with little worry about creating unnecessary work for 
		the responsive layout.
